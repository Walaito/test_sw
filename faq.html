          <div class="question">
            <p>Q: How Much Will Property Taxes Cost?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              A: First-time homebuyers are often shocked at the cost of property
              taxes. Before purchasing a home for the first time, ask what the
              estimated taxes will be on the property. And do your research
              ahead of time so you aren’t surprised by any rate increases.

          <div class="question">
            <p>
              Q: What Other Expenses Should I Expect When Buying a House for the
              First Time?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              A: Depending on where you live and the type of property you
              purchase, there will likely be upfront costs to maintain, furnish
              and secure your new home, including:<br />
              - Maintenance Equipment<br />
              - Furniture<br />
              - Appliances<br />
              - Moving Costs
            </p>

        <!--Question 3-->
        <div class="quest-ans qa03">
          <div class="question">
            <p>
              Q: What Type of Insurance Coverage Will I Need?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              A: Protecting things that matter most to you, including your new
              home, means having the right coverage. As you close on your home,
              a Farm Bureau agent can work with you to determine which home
              insurance coverage best fits your needs and budget.

          <div class="question">
            <p>
              Q: Can I Still Afford to Save as a Homeowner?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              A: Of all the questions to ask yourself when buying a home for the
              first time, this is the one that most people forget. It’s easier
              to think about how much you can spend, but it’s harder to ask how
              much you can save. How much money do you want to stockpile for
              retirement, college and vacations? How much do you want to put
              into personal savings? As you determine how much you can afford on
              your first home purchase, don’t forget to factor in your savings
              goals.
